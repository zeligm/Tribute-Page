          <h3>This is a brief chronology of Carl G. Jung:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1875</strong> - Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau.</li>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> - Began to study medicine at the University of Basel.</li>
            <li><strong>1900</strong> - Started working at the Burghölzli psychiatric hospital in Zürich with Eugen Bleuler.</li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - married Emma Rauschenbach, seven years his junior and the elder daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland.</li>
            <li><strong>1906</strong> - Met Sigmund Freud, who previously had bought a published work by Jung.</li>      
            <li><strong>1909</strong> - traveled with Freud and the Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi to the United States.</li>        
            <li><strong>1913</strong> - Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September. There were tension amongst them since they diverged on key concepts such as the nature of the subconscious or certain views on the libido.</li>
            <li><strong>1913</strong> - at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible "confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, "active imaginations". He recorded everything he felt in small journals. Jung began to transcribe his notes into a large red leather-bound book, on which he worked intermittently for sixteen years.</li>    
            <li><strong>1920</strong> - Jung emerged from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-teens with the publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with Psychological Types, one of his most influential books. There followed a decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels.</li>        
            <li><strong>1959</strong> - continued to publish books until the end of his life, including Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies, which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of UFOs.[56] He also enjoyed a friendship with an English Roman Catholic priest, Father Victor White, who corresponded with Jung after he had published his controversial Answer to Job</li>
            <li><strong>1961</strong> - Died on 6 June at Küsnacht, after a short illness. He had been beset by circulatory diseases.</li>
